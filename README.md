# Video: Abstract ORMs

This video reviews the ways to create objects and their attributes from a database using Ruby and SQL. You will learn how to build the necessary methods needed to extract data from a database and instantiate and save instances of a class using said data. Additionally, you will learn how to build methods that update a database. These methods are built out for a specific class. This lesson covers the logic and mechanics of abstracting each method so that, collectively, they can be applied to any class.
